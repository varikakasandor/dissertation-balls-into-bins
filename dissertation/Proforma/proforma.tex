\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aim of the project was to explore the applicability of Reinforcement Learning methods to optimising load balancing protocols. In particular, to find suitable decision strategies for parametric balls-into-bins protocols, which are abstractions of randomised load balancing.

\section*{Work Completed}

I have completed the success criteria, by investigating Reinforcement Learning approaches to different balls-into-bins protocols, contrasting them with dynamic programming and heuristic algorithms, and analysing them all in a modular, easy-to-use environment. As extensions, several lemmas and conjectures have been formulated about the behaviour of different strategies.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

None.
